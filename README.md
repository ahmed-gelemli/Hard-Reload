# Hard-Reload

I couldn't add it to the Chrome Web Store, but here it is. If you see this you can use it!
If any problem occurs, please add the problem to [Issues Page](https://github.com/ahmed-gelemli/Hard-Reload/issues). 

What it does: when you click the extension icon, it will clear cache and reload the page.

How to add it to the Chrome as Extension:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) in Chrome.
3. Turn on Developer Mode.
4. Click to "Load Unpacked" in the navigation bar.
5. Select cloned repostory folder.

Done! Now, Extension should appear top-right corner. If you click the extension icon, it will clear cache and reload the page. It mostly for Web Developer, who hates cache.  :)
